# tiling-todo

A Clojure desktop application built using Dave Ray's Seesaw library to create and organize multiple todo lists.


## Program state

This program is not yet finished.  The main functionality is there but behind the scenes a decent amount of code needs to be moved from the View to the Controller and the test suite needs to be finished.  As it is it isn't in compliance with MVC or TDD standards.
